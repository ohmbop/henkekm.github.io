[Listen to the album on Bandcamp](https://stopmotionorchestra.bandcamp.com/album/lightworks)

"Clearly the work of the devil" is what your mom would say about this album. To me it's merely a romp through the sweaty undercarriage of a carnival in town for one night only. Obviously, you don't want to go, but the lights and sounds beckon you join them. Upon entry you stand hypnotized, gazing upon a cacophony of the senses that must have leapt from the mind of Hieronymous Bosch himself. Paralyzed, you can do nothing but let the stimulus wash over you, and pray that it ends before you lose something important.
